Inputs: Layer Height, Wall Thickness, Infill Density, Infill Pattern, 
Nozzle Temperature, Bed Temperature, Print Speed, Material (PLA or ABS), Fan Speed

Output: Tension Strength (the maximum stress that a material
can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking).

After the part was manufactured, the following three parameters 
were measured for each product.  Since only Tension Strength is 
required for this analysis, we will eliminate Roughness and Elongation
from the dataset

- Roughness (Âµm)
- Tension Strength (MPa)
- Elongation (%)
